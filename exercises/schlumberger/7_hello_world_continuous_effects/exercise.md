# Hello world with continuous numeric effects

In this variant of the hello world model, we will compute how much air is needed
in the lungs in order to greet people.

Create a domain with the durative `say-hello` action and model how the air in the lungs
is reducing. If there is not enough air to greet a person, action `breath-in` should
inflate the lungs again. But just enough air.

## Challenge

Model walking from one person to another while breathing in.

## PDDL formalism needed
