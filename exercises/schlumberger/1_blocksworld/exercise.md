# Exercise 1: BlocksWorld

Objective: Change the BlocksWorld domain so that there are 2 (or more) grippers instead of the implicit single gripper.

## Things to consider

* What types do we need to add?
* What predicates do we need to change?
* What objects do we need to add?
* How do we change the actions?

## Testing your solution

Run the planner by right-clicking on the domain or problem files and selecting _PDDL: Run the planner and display the plan_.
You can try to build the problem file visually, or just animate your plan on the [Blocksworld animation](https://blocks-dot-ai-planning.appspot.com/) page.

## Need help?

While this exercise is meant to be done with lot of hand holding, the PDDL constructs exercised are:

* [Types](https://planning.wiki/ref/pddl/domain#object-types)
* [Objects](https://planning.wiki/ref/pddl/problem#objects)

If you are unsure where to start, the live coding demo is in this video: [Modeling in PDDL - Episode 1 - Blocksworld](https://youtu.be/_NOVa4i7Us8).
