# Exercise: Hello world - solution hints

For those not following the training in a classroom, here are a few hints for how to arrive at a working solution:

1. The message you want to print needs to be the action name itself, because the planner outputs plans consisting of actions and their timing.
1. The planner would not put the action into the plan, unless it achieves something useful - the goal.
1. You need one predicate that needs to be included in the goal and also achieved by your action effect.
1. Types, objects or parameters are not necessary in this exercise.

If you ever programmed using any imperative/procedural language ... then forget about that! Put yourself into mindset of goal-oriented declarative programming.
